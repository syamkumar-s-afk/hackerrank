Given a string of lowercase English characters, transform it into a palindrome by rearranging and deleting characters from the string.
Find the minimum number of deletions required so that the remaining string can be rearranged into a palindrome.

Note: A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as "racecar" or "level".

**Example 1**
Input: s = "abcedda"
Output: 2
Explanation:
Possible approaches:
- Remove characters at positions 1 and 2 to get "aedda", which can be rearranged into "adeda".
- Remove characters at positions 1, 2, and 3 to get "adda", which is already a palindrome.
The first approach is optimal.

**Example 2**
Input: s = "abdaa"
Output: 2
Explanation:
One optimal solution for transforming "abdaa" into a palindrome is to remove the characters 'b' and 'd', resulting in "aaa".

**Constraints**
- 0 ≤ length of string ≤ 2*10^6
- string consists of lowercase English letters

Given an array of integers \`nums\` and an integer \`target\`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to \`target\`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
